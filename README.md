My name is Julien VALENTIN. At the creation of this repo, I am 27 seven years old. I currently work in a startup in La Rochelle, France, as a R & D Engineer. My mission is to develop and to implement powerful numerical tools in order to modelize and simulate fabrication processes of composites materials. The maths of this topic is formulated in the continuum mechanics formalism, that allows to write non-linear elasticity problems and rheological fluid flows too. Then, one is able to discretize these systems of equations and to call efficient algorithms in order to solve them. 

If I started my studies with engineering pretty early in High School, I wanted to study the mathematics behind the scene and to understand the fundamental concepts of physics that justify the models used in engineering, so, after one year in CentraleSupélec, I resigned. After that, I came once and for all in University (Sorbonne-Université, Paris, France) and obtained my graduation in applied maths. Now, I am back in the lab, aware of the methods that lead from basic concepts to pretty complex system models. I am able to understand the objects, the hypothesis, and the analysis steps that appear before the software development. Let's code !

Out of the office, I am very curious of data science and machine learning.

## ... this repo <!-- omit in toc -->

This repo means to introduce what I know about computer science and its applications to applied maths and industrial issues. As a young teacher in EPITA (Paris, France), a software engineering school, I also mean to develop teaching materials for my students.

# The environment

I work on [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11) with [W.S.L v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) with the famous [Debian](https://www.debian.org/index.en.html) distribution.

## I.D.Es

My favourite I.D.E is [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) software, that I do not really use actually. I develop my scripts in [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write simple programs in my favourites languages. In [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), I recommand these extensions

## Version control and project management

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an abvious choice to manage a project. I use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to stock and share these remotely on [Github](https://github.com/).

## Containeering

Some tools are a bit tricky to deploy, but are often available through a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image. That is why one should consider to install it on his computer.

## Sample of useful languages...

All of the following are freely available programming languages that suit for engineering or maths developments.

- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
- [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- [Fortran90](https://www.fortran90.org/)
- [FreeFEM++](https://freefem.org/)
- [GNU Plot](http://www.gnuplot.info/)
- [Julia](https://julialang.org)
- [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Rheolef](https://membres-ljk.imag.fr/Pierre.Saramito/rheolef/html/index.html)
- [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)
- [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/)
- [SLEPc](https://slepc.upv.es/)
- ...

## Other useful platforms...

- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
- [FEniCs](https://fenicsproject.org/)
- [MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/)
- [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- ...

## Package managers

Package managers allow to maintain efficiently a development environment. For instance, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is very popular and powerful. In practice, one may install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), a minimal distribution of *Anaconda*. An alternative to *Anaconda* is [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
